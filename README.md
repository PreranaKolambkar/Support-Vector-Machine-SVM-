# Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-
This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the class of mushrooms based on their attributes using the Mushroom Dataset. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that works well for classification tasks, especially in high-dimensional spaces.
